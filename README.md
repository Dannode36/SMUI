# SMUI
 UI library designed for SMAPI (Stardew Valley Modding API)

**Make sure to include 	```<BundleExtraAssemblies>ThirdParty</BundleExtraAssemblies>``` OR 	```<BundleExtraAssemblies>All</BundleExtraAssemblies>``` OR ```<CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>``` when using external references such as SMUI to make sure it gets included in the output directory/mod folder on build** otherwise expect somthing along the lines of ```AssemblyResolutionException: Failed to resolve assembly: 'SMUI...``` to appear in your SMAPI log
